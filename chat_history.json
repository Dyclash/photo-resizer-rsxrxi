Create the basic UI elements for the photo resizer app.\n2.  Implement the photo upload functionality, allowing the user to upload up to 12 photos.\n3.  Implement the photo resizing functionality to resize the images to the specified iOS App Store dimensions.\n4.  Create a text input field for the user to describe their app.\n5.  Implement the text generation functionality to generate a Promotional Text, Description, and Keywords based on the user's input.\n6.  Display the generated Promotional Text, Description, and Keywords in the UI.\n7.  Make sure the app/(tabs) folder is modified to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n8.
