Users can:\n- Clear their app data (photos, descriptions, metadata) while keeping their stats\n- Reset the entire app to factory settings (everything cleared)\n- See clear descriptions of what each action does\n- Get confirmation dialogs before any destructive action\n- Receive success/error feedback after operations"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-11-25T01:59:47Z"}]
